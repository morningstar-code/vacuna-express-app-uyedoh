Here's a plan to get started:\n\n**Acknowledging the User's Request:**\n\nThis proposal outlines the initial design and feature set for the Vacunaexpress.com mobile application, focusing on vaccine distribution. The app will enable clients to create accounts, browse vaccines by age group, place orders, track them in real-time, and manage their invoices and payments.\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Account Creation/Login:** Secure screens for user registration (collecting RNC, ID, address, email, and phone number) and login.\n*   **Vaccine Catalog:** A browsable catalog of vaccines, clearly organized by age group (Universal, Ni\u00f1os, Adolescentes, Adultos), with details on doses and age suitability.\n*   **Order Placement & Tracking:** Functionality to place orders for vaccines and track their status in real-time.\n*   **Profile Management:** A section where users can view their invoices, check order status, and see any pending balances.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F9FAFB` (Very light grey, almost white)\n    *   Text: `#1F2937` (Dark grey for primary text)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#6B7280` (Medium grey for less important text)\n    *   Primary: `#007BFF` (A classic blue for primary actions and branding)\n    *   Secondary: `#6C757D` (A softer grey for secondary actions)\n    *   Accent: `#28A745` (A green for positive confirmations, like successful order placement)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White for cards and containers)\n    *   Highlight: `#FFC107` (A yellow for highlighting important information)\n*   **Typography:** Use modern, clean fonts like \"System\" for a native feel.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Create new screens:**\n    *   Create a `LoginScreen.tsx` and `RegisterScreen.tsx` in the `app/` directory.\n    *   Create a `VaccineCatalogScreen.tsx` in the `app/` directory.\n    *   Create an `OrderTrackingScreen.tsx` in the `app/` directory.\n    *   Create a `ProfileScreen.tsx` in the `app/` directory.\n2.  **Modify the Tab Layout:**\n    *   Modify `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` to include tabs for \"Home\", \"Catalog\", \"Orders\", and \"Profile\".\n    *   The \"Home\" tab should navigate to a welcome screen.\n    *   The \"Catalog\" tab should navigate to the `VaccineCatalogScreen.tsx`.\n    *   The \"Orders\" tab should navigate to the `OrderTrackingScreen.tsx`.\n    *   The \"Profile\" tab should navigate to the `ProfileScreen.tsx`.\n3.  **Implement basic UI:**\n    *   In each of the new screens, add placeholder text to confirm the navigation is working correctly.\n4.  **Remove modal demos:**\n    *   Remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-03T06:51:41.696002"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create the Vacunaexpress.com mobile app for vaccine distribution.
